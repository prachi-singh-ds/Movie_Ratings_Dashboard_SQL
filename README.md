This SQL-based **Hospital Management System** is developed as part of my Data Science learning journey. The project demonstrates how structured data can be managed, queried, and analyzed in a hospital setup using Microsoft SQL Server.

---

## üìå About the Project

The Hospital Management System simulates data operations for a hospital, including patients, doctors, staff, treatments, appointments, and billing. I used **MS SQL Server** to create and manage relational tables, insert data, and perform SQL queries for insights and reporting.

This project helps build a strong foundation in:

- SQL Table Design & Relationships  
- Data Insertion & Updates  
- Querying Real-world Scenarios  
- Data Filtering, Aggregation & Joins  
- Grouping & Conditional Queries  

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Microsoft SQL Server  
- SQL Queries (DQL, DML, Joins, Aggregates)  
- Excel (for initial data planning)  
- GitHub (for version control)

## üì∑ Project Screenshots (12 Total)

Below are key screenshots representing different aspects of the project:

1. **Create Tables** ‚Äì Defined structure for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Billing, etc.  
2. **Insert Data** ‚Äì Inserted mock data into all tables using `INSERT INTO`.  
3. **Simple SELECT Query** ‚Äì Displayed patient details.  
4. **WHERE Clause** ‚Äì Retrieved admitted patients using conditions.  
5. **LIKE Clause** ‚Äì Filtered patient names starting with 'S'.  
6. **ORDER BY Clause** ‚Äì Sorted patients by admission date.  
7. **AGGREGATE Function (COUNT)** ‚Äì Counted number of active doctors.  
8. **GROUP BY Clause** ‚Äì Grouped patients by ward and counted them.  
9. **JOIN Query** ‚Äì Combined Patients and Appointments info.  
10. **Subquery** ‚Äì Fetched most expensive treatment cost.  
11. **TOP Clause** ‚Äì Displayed top 3 billing amounts.  
12. **UPDATE Query** ‚Äì Updated discharged status of patients.

‚úî All screenshots are saved with these numbers for clarity.
